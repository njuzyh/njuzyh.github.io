I am Yuhang Zhou (周 宇航), a fourth-year CS Ph.D. candidate at NASA Group, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology,
School of Computer Science, Nanjing University. I am currently advised by [Prof. Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/index.htm). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Nanjing University.

My research mainly focuses on systems for machine learning, distributed deep learning, and performance profiling and tuning.

This is my [CV](../assets/yuhangzhou_CV.pdf).
